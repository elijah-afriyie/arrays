# Java 2D Array Example

This project demonstrates a Java program that uses a 2D array to store a list of favorite cars and prints them using nested `for` loops. The size of the array is specified.

## Getting Started

Create a file named `Main.java` and implement the following functionality:

1. **Declare and Initialize a 2D Array**: Create a 2D array to store favorite cars with a specified size.
2. **Assign Values to the Array**: Populate the array with car names.
3. **Print the Array**: Use nested `for` loops to print the car names stored in the array.

## Compilation and Execution

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `Main.java`.
2. Compile the program using the following command:

```sh
javac Main.java
```

3. Run the program with the following command:

```sh
java Main
```

## Notes

- The 2D array should have a specified size.
- Each element in the 2D array should be assigned a value representing a favorite car.
- Nested `for` loops should be used to iterate over the 2D array and print the values.
